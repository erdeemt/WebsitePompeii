        <p>Pompeii is a wonderful example that displays ancient Roman architecture where it portrays what life was like in ancient Rome and how their buildings and communities were seen from a structural lookout. The house around Pompeii was wrapped with numerous pieces of art that took the shape of frescoes on the walls and they are still visible. Historians could make a great deal of study into ancient Rome and Roman architecture through this work of art.

            There are four different styles of frescos – from the early ones to the latest. The first one was called Incrustation Style which meant painting artificial slabs of precious-colored marbles on the walls. The second one was the Architectural Style which was a popular one as it created optical illusions and depended on perspectives. Large-sized trees were painted on the walls to give it an exterior vibe on the whole.
            
            Ornate Style being the third one used basic colors and a lot of surface ornamentation and the art was developed from the artist’s imagination. The last one is the Intricate Style which is a combination of all three styles in one. There was the use of faux marble blocks, illusion, and different landscapes.</p>
